last_pitch passing for eventsg() / playe()
------------------------------------------
fix/figure_out how prev_pitch/last_pitch passing
should work with eventsg-style generator loops.
when you eventsg() 2 separate events loops in series,
you have an interesting conundrum -
    the 2nd eventsg(), which accepts prev_pitch,
    is already created prior to you really knowing
    the last_pitch of the first eventsg(), which
    you get as the return val of playe()


doublecheck - leading hyphen means no pause?


musictxt - multiple parts playing at a time


add drums playing along with stuff


global transpose (within fns.py interface)


some examples in the README.md of how to use this thing


DONE
----

portability - include strict_typing.py in project or stop using it
