Music Fun in Python
===================

This module provides a framework of functionality for working
with MIDI-message-based music in Python, including:

* Functions for playing notes, chords, melodies (see midi.py)
* Functions for storing and playing back a song as a Python program (see fns.py)
* Functions for tracking simple rhythms of a real-time input (see rhythm.py)

Stay tuned for more information about this project.
